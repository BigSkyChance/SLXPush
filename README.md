SLX Code Push


This script will need to be ran from a folder in the Jump server, the only accompanying file that will need to be updated before running the script will be the text file that simply needs to contain the IPs you wish to send the command to.

This script is not the one reflected in the Jump server as there are privacy concerns with IPs/Commands/Etc.
